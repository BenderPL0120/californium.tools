A JavaFX application that uses the Californium client to discover and interact with servers.

Note: The binary artifact created in the target folder does not contain any JavaFX classes.
Please make sure that JavaFX is available from your system class path before running the application.

Alternatively, when building using Java 11 or later, the application can be started from the
source folder using
```sh
mvn javafx:run
```
